# 100 Prisoners Problem Simulator

🌐 Interactive Web App 

This project is based on the classic **100 Prisoners Problem** probability puzzle and simulation strategy.

## Project Structure

The project has two parts:

• C++ simulation, core algorithm and statistical simulation logic  ( link: https://github.com/KoscAnt/100-prisoners-problem-simulator )
• Interactive web application, visual and interactive simulator

## What I built myself

The original simulation logic and algorithm were implemented by me in C++.  
This includes:

- matrix generation
- permutation logic
- cycle-following strategy
- statistical simulation runs
- success rate calculation
- multiple scenario sizes

## Web Application Version

I later transformed the simulation into an interactive web application to make the concept easier to explore visually and interactively.

The web version includes:

- custom simulation mode
- automated simulation runs
- statistical mode (10,000 runs)
- interactive box opening
- live logs and summaries

## AI Assistance Disclosure

AI tools (Codex-style assistance) were used to help translate and adapt the C++ simulation logic into the JavaScript/web application version and to speed up UI implementation.

All core logic decisions, algorithm understanding, testing, and structure were done by me.

## Goal of the Project

To demonstrate:

- algorithmic thinking
- simulation modeling
- probability strategy implementation
- translating logic across languages 
- building interactive educational tools
